Here's where to keep these files:
credentials.json
token.json

The tokens will have to be updated as necessary.


In the `dev-test` folder, there are credentials for the dev-test email account.
In the `business` folder, there are credentials for the business email account.


(You could just keep the real files in the dev-test and business folders and
have a symbolic link pointing to whichever files you are currently using,
whether dev-test or business.)
